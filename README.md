The pagination simply does not work properly. I cannot fix it.

Tutorial link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8&t (Ben Awad).
An old tutorial so some of changes had to be made.

HOSTED ON AZURE AND VERCEL
note: Azure auto pauses my cheap db, so it may take a while for it to wake up

The most important thing for me was, that it is focused on GraphQl, which exactly what I was looking for.

This is another one of those tutorials that really go deep, explain all the details and do most things by hand.
The project it self is not even that impressive but it really teaches you a lot.
And the guy that made it is really good at what he does. He reminds of university professors. He knows his stuff.

I have used Prisma instead of TypeOrm/MicroOrm since it is (for me) much easier to use.
When I was using TypeOrm it just would not work no matter what. After switching to Prisma it worked first try. That is why I love it.

Usually, I use Tailwind with Shadcn for UI, but here I used Chakra since its what was used in the tutorial and it's also fine. All UI stuff is just CSS at the end of the day.

I am using 2 databases, one mySql and another Redis. Kind of what you would do in a proper application. 
But I think that this way can be more expensive, since you might need to pay for 2 databases. It dependes what you use.
At the end of the day, everything is hosted on "the big 3" providers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon).
